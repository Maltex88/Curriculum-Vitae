    Title: 'Project BoostApp - Internship',
    About:
      'The goal of the project was to develop an iOS and Andorid app to let Sigma employees compete in physical activities. The team followed a textbook example of scrum with dailys, retro, sprintplanning and weekly demos of the app to show our PO.',
    Role: `I was the only Frontend developer in this project and communicated what the project needed in form of the data provided by my backend colleagues. We wanted to work as close to textbook scrum as possible to learn the ins and outs of the agile workflow. 
        
Every week we switched the roll of scrum-master and i got to work on my leadership skills aswell as my verbal communication infront of a group. I learned and grew alot in this project and some of the nuggets of gold i will take with me in my next projects is the authentic experience Sigma created. From learning how to setup a team and figuring out the stack to publishing the application.`,
